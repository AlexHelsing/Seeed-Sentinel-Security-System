# Thief Detector 



## Introduction

The thief detector project is a security system designed and created by the Group 4 of DIT113-2023 of the University of Gothenburg to provide an added layer of protection for homes or 
businesses by detecting potential intrusions and sending alerts to the homeowner or business owner. 
The system uses a variety of sensors, including a PIR sensor, a speaker, an LED, a microphone, a joystick, and 
a keypad sign-in to detect any unauthorized entry. When the door is opened, the person has a certain amount of time to 
deactivate the alarm on the WIO (Wireless Input/Output) device before "Intruder mode" is initiated. 
During "Intruder mode," the system will send an automated message to the homeowner or business owner, 
alerting them to the potential intrusion.

Description:
Our project aims to create a thief detection system using various sensors, including a PIR sensor, a speaker, an LED, 
a microphone, a joystick, and a keypad sign-in. The system is designed to provide an added layer of security for homes 
or businesses, allowing individuals to feel more secure and protected from potential burglaries or break-ins. 
When the door is opened, the person has a certain amount of time to deactivate the alarm on the WIO 
(Wireless Input/Output) device before "Intruder mode" is initiated. During "Intruder mode," the system will send an automated message to the homeowner, alerting them to the potential intrusion. The homeowner can then react accordingly, such as calling the police or checking their home security cameras.


Team Contract:
Weekly meetings every Wednesday from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM at Lindholmen.
Team members to inform the group of their schedule in advance, including their working hours
Shared leadership role among team members


All team members agreed that main communication platform is Discord. Weekly meetings will be held every Wednesday from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM at Lindholmen to discuss project progress and address any issues or concerns. In the event of any circumstances that require additional or emergency meetings, we will decide on an appropriate time together during our weekly meetings or through the primary communication channel. Furthermore, our TA meetings will occur every Wednesday from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM at Lindholmen.

In order to keep everyone on the same page and manage our time effectively, it was agreed that team members should inform the group of their schedule in advance, including their working hours. The weekly group meeting will be held on Wednesdays, and all team members are expected to attend.

Each team member will be assigned specific tasks and responsibilities for the project, with predetermined deadlines. It is the responsibility of each team member to complete their assigned tasks and work cooperatively with others to accomplish the project's objectives. The distribution of tasks and providing weekly updates on our individual progress will be done during meetings. It is expected that all team members will come prepared to contribute.

To manage our project effectively, we decided to share the leadership role.
